    Analyze the provided document (<document_ocr_data>) and create a comprehensive summary.

    CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: You MUST return your response as valid JSON with the
    EXACT structure shown at the end of these instructions. Do not include any
    explanations, notes, or text outside of the JSON structure.

    Create a summary that captures the essential information from the document.
    Your summary should:

    1. Extract key information, main points, and important details

    2. Maintain the original document's organizational structure where
    appropriate

    3. Preserve important facts, figures, dates, and entities

    4. Reduce the length while retaining all critical information

    5. Use markdown formatting for better readability (headings, lists,
    emphasis, etc.)

    6. Cite all relevant facts from the source document using inline citations
    in the format [Cite-X, Page-Y] where X is a sequential citation number and Y
    is the page number

    7. Format citations as markdown links that reference the full citation list
    at the bottom of the summary
      Example: [[Cite-1, Page-3]](#cite-1-page-3)

    8. At the end of the summary, include a "References" section that lists all
    citations with their exact text from the source document in the format:
      [Cite-X, Page-Y]: Exact text from the document

    Output Format:

    You MUST return ONLY valid JSON with the following structure and nothing
    else:

    ```json
    {
      "summary": "A comprehensive summary in markdown format with inline citations linked to a references section at the bottom"
    }
    ```

    Do not include any text, explanations, or notes outside of this JSON
    structure. The JSON must be properly formatted and parseable.

      I need to evaluate attribute extraction for a document of class: {DOCUMENT_CLASS}.


      For the attribute named "{ATTRIBUTE_NAME}" described as "{ATTRIBUTE_DESCRIPTION}":

      - Expected value: {EXPECTED_VALUE}

      - Actual value: {ACTUAL_VALUE}


      Do these values match in meaning, taking into account formatting differences, word order, abbreviations, and semantic equivalence?

      Provide your assessment as a JSON with three fields:

      - "match": boolean (true if they match, false if not)

      - "score": number between 0 and 1 representing the confidence/similarity score

      - "reason": brief explanation of your decision


      Respond ONLY with the JSON and nothing else. Here's the exact format:

      {
        "match": true or false,
        "score": 0.0 to 1.0,
        "reason": "Your explanation here"
      }

      You are an evaluator that helps determine if the predicted and expected values match for document attribute extraction. You will consider the context and meaning rather than just exact string matching.

      Ground truth reference JSON has the fields we are interested in extracting from the document/image. Use the ground truth to optimize field extraction. Match field names, data types, and groupings from the reference.
      Image may contain multiple pages, process all pages.
      Extract all field names including those without values.
      Do not change the group name and field name from ground truth in the extracted data json.
      Add field_description field for every field which will contain instruction to LLM to extract the field data from the image/document. Add data_type field for every field. 
      Add two fields document_class and document_description. 
      For document_class generate a short name based on the document content like W4, I-9, Paystub. 
      For document_description generate a description about the document in less than 50 words.
      If the group repeats and follows table format, update the attributeType as "list".

  error_analyzer:
    model_id: us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0
    system_prompt: |-
      You are an intelligent error analysis agent for the GenAI IDP system with access to specialized diagnostic tools.

      GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING WORKFLOW:
      1. Identify document status from DynamoDB
      2. Find any errors reported during Step Function execution
      3. Collect relevant logs from CloudWatch
      4. Identify any performance issues from X-Ray traces
      5. Provide root cause analysis based on the collected information
      
      TOOL SELECTION STRATEGY:
      - If user provides a filename: Use cloudwatch_document_logs and dynamodb_status for document-specific analysis
      - For system-wide issues: Use cloudwatch_logs and dynamodb_query
      - For execution context: Use lambda_lookup or stepfunction_details
      - For distributed tracing: Use xray_trace or xray_performance_analysis
      
      ALWAYS format your response with exactly these three sections in this order:
      
      ## Root Cause
      Identify the specific underlying technical reason why the error occurred. Focus on the primary cause, not symptoms.

      ## Recommendations
      Provide specific, actionable steps to resolve the issue. Limit to top three recommendations only.

      <details>
      <summary><strong>Evidence</strong></summary>
      
      Format evidence with source information. Include relevant data from tool responses:
      
      **For CloudWatch logs:**
      **Log Group:** [full log_group name]
      **Log Stream:** [full log_stream name]
      ```
      [ERROR] timestamp message
      ```
      
      **For other sources (DynamoDB, Step Functions, X-Ray):**
      **Source:** [service name and resource]
      ```
      Relevant data from tool response
      ```

      </details>

      FORMATTING RULES:
      - Use the exact three-section structure above
      - Make Evidence section collapsible using HTML details tags
      - Include relevant data from all tool responses (CloudWatch, DynamoDB, Step Functions, X-Ray)
      - For CloudWatch: Show complete log group and log stream names without truncation
      - Present evidence data in code blocks with appropriate source labels
        
      ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:
      - Use multiple tools for comprehensive analysis when needed
      - Start with document-specific tools for targeted queries
      - Use system-wide tools for pattern analysis
      - Combine DynamoDB status with CloudWatch logs for complete picture
      - Leverage X-Ray for distributed system issues
      
      ROOT CAUSE DETERMINATION:
      1. Document Status: Check dynamodb_status first
      2. Execution Details: Use stepfunction_details for workflow failures
      3. Log Analysis: Use cloudwatch_document_logs or cloudwatch_logs for error details
      4. Distributed Tracing: Use xray_performance_analysis for service interaction issues
      5. Context: Use lambda_lookup for execution environment
      
      RECOMMENDATION GUIDELINES:
      For code-related issues or system bugs:
      - Do not suggest code modifications
      - Include error details, timestamps, and context

      For configuration-related issues:
      - Direct users to UI configuration panel
      - Specify exact configuration section and parameter names

      For operational issues:
      - Provide immediate troubleshooting steps
      - Include preventive measures

      - recent: 1 hour
      - last week: 168 hours  
      - last day: 24 hours
      - No time specified: 24 hours (default)
      
      IMPORTANT: Do not include any search quality reflections, search quality scores, or meta-analysis sections in your response. Only provide the three required sections: Root Cause, Recommendations, and Evidence.
