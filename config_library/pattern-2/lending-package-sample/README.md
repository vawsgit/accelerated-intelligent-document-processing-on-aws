# Default-Lending Configuration

This directory contains the default-lending configuration for the GenAI IDP Accelerator. This configuration is specifically designed for processing lending and financial document packages commonly used in loan applications, underwriting, and financial verification processes.

## Pattern Association

**Pattern**: Pattern-2 - Uses Textract or Amazon Bedrock models for both page classification/grouping and information extraction

## Validation Level

**Level**: 2 - Minimal Testing

- **Testing Evidence**: This configuration has been lightly tested with lending sample document including payslips, driver's licenses, bank statements, checks, W2 forms, and insurance applications. 
- **Known Limitations**: Performance may vary with non-standard document formats, heavily redacted financial documents, or documents with poor image quality that affect OCR accuracy.

## Overview

The default-lending configuration is designed to handle comprehensive lending document packages typically encountered in:

- **Loan Applications**: Personal and commercial lending
- **Mortgage Processing**: Home loan documentation
- **Credit Assessment**: Income and asset verification
- **Underwriting**: Risk assessment documentation
- **Compliance Verification**: Financial record validation

It includes specialized settings for document classification, detailed financial information extraction, and document summarization using Amazon Bedrock models optimized for financial document processing.

## Key Components

### Document Classes

The configuration defines 6 specialized lending document classes, each with comprehensive attributes for detailed financial data extraction:

- **Payslip**: Employee wage statements with detailed earnings, deductions, taxes, and year-to-date totals (21 simple attributes, 3 group attributes, 3 list attributes)
- **US-drivers-licenses**: Government-issued identification documents with personal information and driving privileges (7 simple attributes, 3 group attributes, 2 list attributes)
- **Bank-checks**: Written financial instruments with payment details and account information (11 simple attributes)
- **Bank-Statement**: Periodic financial reports with account activity and transaction details (8 simple attributes, 2 list attributes)
- **W2**: Annual tax documents with comprehensive wage and tax withholding information (2 simple attributes, 5 group attributes, 2 list attributes)
- **Homeowners-Insurance-Application**: Insurance coverage applications with detailed applicant and property information (10 simple attributes, 3 group attributes)

### Classification Settings

- **Model**: Amazon Nova Pro
- **Method**: Multimodal Page Level Classification
- **Temperature**: 0 (deterministic outputs)
- **Top-k**: 5
- **OCR Backend**: Amazon Textract with LAYOUT, TABLES, and SIGNATURES features

The classification component analyzes document content and structure to accurately identify lending document types and establish proper page boundaries within multi-document packages.

### Extraction Settings

- **Model**: Amazon Nova Pro
- **Temperature**: 0 (deterministic outputs)
- **Top-k**: 5
- **Max Tokens**: 10,000 (increased for detailed financial data)

The extraction component performs comprehensive attribute extraction tailored to each lending document type, capturing critical financial information including:
- Detailed income and deduction breakdowns
- Personal identification information
- Account numbers and financial institution details
- Tax withholding and year-to-date totals
- Insurance coverage details and applicant information

### Assessment Settings

- **Model**: us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0
- **Granular Assessment**: Enabled with parallel processing
- **Default Confidence Threshold**: 0.9
- **Max Workers**: 20 for improved performance

Enhanced confidence assessment ensures high accuracy for financial data extraction, critical for lending decisions.

### Summarization Settings

- **Model**: us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0
- **Temperature**: 0 (deterministic outputs)
- **Top-k**: 5

The summarization component creates structured summaries of lending documents with proper citations, essential for loan documentation and compliance.

## Sample Documents

This configuration is optimized for processing lending document packages that typically include:

- **Income Verification**: Payslips, W2 forms, tax returns
- **Identity Verification**: Driver's licenses, state IDs
- **Asset Verification**: Bank statements, investment accounts
- **Payment History**: Bank checks, payment records
- **Insurance Documentation**: Homeowner's insurance applications and policies

## How to Use

To use this default-lending configuration:

1. **Direct Deployment**: Deploy the GenAI IDP Accelerator with this Pattern-2 configuration for lending document processing workflows.

2. **Loan Processing Integration**: Integrate with existing loan origination systems for automated document processing and data extraction.

3. **Compliance Workflows**: Use for regulatory compliance documentation and audit trail generation.

4. **Custom Lending Workflows**: Adapt for specific lending scenarios:


## Common Customization Scenarios

### Adding New Financial Document Classes

To add additional lending document types (e.g., tax returns, employment verification letters):

1. Add a new entry to the `classes` array:
   ```yaml
   - name: tax_return
     description: Individual or business tax return documents containing income and deduction information
     attributes:
       - name: tax_year
         description: The tax year for which the return was filed. Look for 'Tax Year' or year designation at the top of the form.
       - name: filing_status
         description: The taxpayer's filing status such as Single, Married Filing Jointly, etc.
   ```

2. Test with representative tax return documents.

### Customizing Extraction Prompts for Compliance

For enhanced compliance and audit requirements:

1. Modify the extraction `task_prompt` to include compliance-specific instructions:
   ```yaml
   task_prompt: |
     Extract financial information with particular attention to:
     - Verification of income sources and amounts
     - Identification of any discrepancies or missing information
     - Compliance with lending regulatory requirements
   ```

### Adjusting Confidence Thresholds for Financial Data

For critical lending decisions, you may want higher confidence thresholds:

1. Update the `default_confidence_threshold` in the assessment section:
   ```yaml
   assessment:
     default_confidence_threshold: '0.95'  # Higher threshold for financial data
   ```

### Regional Customization

For different geographic regions with varying document formats:

1. Create region-specific configurations:
   ```bash
   cp -r default-lending default-lending-ca  # Canadian lending documents
   cp -r default-lending default-lending-uk  # UK lending documents
   ```

2. Modify document classes and attributes for regional requirements.

## Performance Considerations

The default-lending configuration is optimized for:

- **High Accuracy**: Temperature 0 and elevated confidence thresholds for reliable financial data extraction
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Detailed attribute definitions covering all critical lending information
- **Compliance**: Structured outputs suitable for regulatory documentation and audit trails
- **Scalability**: Granular assessment with parallel processing for high-volume lending workflows

### Financial Data Specific Optimizations

- **OCR Enhancement**: Uses SIGNATURES feature to detect signed documents
- **Table Processing**: TABLES feature for structured financial data in statements
- **Layout Preservation**: LAYOUT feature maintains document structure for complex forms
- **Extended Token Limits**: 10,000 tokens for comprehensive financial document processing

## Security and Compliance Considerations

When processing lending documents:

- **Data Privacy**: Ensure compliance with financial privacy regulations (GLBA, CCPA, etc.)
- **Encryption**: Use encrypted storage and transmission for all financial documents
- **Access Controls**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
- **Audit Logging**: Maintain comprehensive logs for regulatory compliance
- **Data Retention**: Follow applicable data retention policies for financial records

## Integration Guidelines

### Loan Origination Systems (LOS)

This configuration can be integrated with popular LOS platforms:
- Automated document classification upon upload
- Real-time data extraction for loan application prefill
- Exception handling for documents requiring manual review

### Credit Decisioning

Extracted data can feed directly into credit decisioning engines:
- Income verification from payslips and W2s
- Asset verification from bank statements
- Identity verification from driver's licenses
