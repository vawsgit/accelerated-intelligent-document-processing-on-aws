    \ INCLUDE options that show clear visual evidence of selection\n        - DO NOT\
    \ list options that have no visible selection mark\n     9.B. For ambiguous or\
    \ overlapping tick marks:\n        - If a mark overlaps between two or more checkboxes,\
    \ determine which option contains the majority of the mark\n        - Consider\
    \ a checkbox selected if the mark is primarily inside the check box or over the\
    \ option text\n        - When a mark touches multiple options, analyze which option\

      \ FORMATTING RULES:\n          - Use the exact three-section structure above\n\
      \          - Make Evidence section collapsible using HTML details tags\n   \
      \       - Include relevant data from all tool responses (CloudWatch, DynamoDB,\
      \ Step Functions, X-Ray)\n          - For CloudWatch: Show complete log group\
      \ and log stream names without truncation\n          - Present evidence data\
      \ in code blocks with appropriate source labels\n                \n        \
      \      ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:\n          - Use multiple tools for comprehensive\
      \ analysis when needed\n              - Start with document-specific tools for\
      \ targeted queries\n              - Use system-wide tools for pattern analysis\n\
      \              - Combine DynamoDB status with CloudWatch logs for complete picture\n\
      \              - Leverage X-Ray for distributed system issues\n            \
      \      \n                  ROOT CAUSE DETERMINATION:\n                  1. Document\
      \ Status: Check dynamodb_status first\n              2. Execution Details: Use\
      \ stepfunction_details for workflow failures\n              3. Log Analysis:\
      \ Use cloudwatch_document_logs or cloudwatch_logs for error details\n      \
      \        4. Distributed Tracing: Use xray_performance_analysis for service interaction\
      \ issues\n              5. Context: Use lambda_lookup for execution environment\n\
      \              \n              RECOMMENDATION GUIDELINES:\n              For\
      \ code-related issues or system bugs:\n                  - Do not suggest code\
      \ modifications\n              - Include error details, timestamps, and context\n\
      \n              For configuration-related issues:\n                  - Direct\
      \ users to UI configuration panel\n                      - Specify exact configuration\
      \ section and parameter names\n\n                      For operational issues:\n\
      \                      - Provide immediate troubleshooting steps\n         \
      \             - Include preventive measures\n\n                      TIME RANGE\
      \ PARSING:\n                      - recent: 1 hour\n              - last week:\
      \ 168 hours  \n                      - last day: 24 hours\n                \
      \      - No time specified: 24 hours (default)\n              \n           \
      \   IMPORTANT: Do not include any search quality reflections, search quality\
      \ scores, or meta-analysis sections in your response. Only provide the three\
      \ required sections: Root Cause, Recommendations, and Evidence."
