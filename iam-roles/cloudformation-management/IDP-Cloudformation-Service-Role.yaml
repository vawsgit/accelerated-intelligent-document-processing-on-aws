Description: >
  This template creates a CloudFormation Service Role for the IDP Accelerator solution. 
  This role grants permissions to create, update, and delete IDP CloudFormation
  stacks and their resources. It follows the principle of least privilege
  by allowing only the necessary actions for stack management. This template also
  creates a user permission policy that allows users to pass the CloudFormation
  service role to CloudFormation. The iam:PassRole policy must be attached to
  the user or role that will be using the CloudFormation Service Role in order
  to successfully pass the role.
