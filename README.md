## Introduction

A scalable, serverless solution for automated document processing and information extraction using AWS services. This system combines OCR capabilities with generative AI to convert unstructured documents into structured data at scale.

White-glove customization, deployment, and integration support for production use cases is also available through [AWS Professional Services](https://aws.amazon.com/professional-services/).

## Alternative Implementations

**Prefer AWS CDK?** This solution is also available as [GenAI IDP Accelerator for AWS CDK](https://github.com/cdklabs/genai-idp), providing the same functional capabilities through AWS CDK constructs for customers who prefer Infrastructure-as-Code with CDK.

**Prefer Terraform?** This solution is also available as [GenAI IDP Terraform](https://github.com/awslabs/genai-idp-terraform), providing the same functional capabilities as a Terraform module that integrates with existing infrastructure and supports customization through module variables.

## Key Features

- **Modular, pluggable patterns**: Pre-built processing patterns using state-of-the-art models and AWS services
- **Command Line Interface**: Programmatic batch processing with evaluation framework and analytics integration
- **Advanced Classification**: Support for page-level and holistic document packet classification

- **Extraction Confidence Assessment**: LLM-powered assessment of extraction confidence with multimodal document analysis
- **Document Knowledge Base Query**: Ask questions about your processed documents
- **IDP Accelerator Help Chat Bot**: Ask questions about the IDP code base or features
- **MCP Integration**: Model Context Protocol integration enabling external applications like Amazon Quick Suite to access IDP data and analytics through AWS Bedrock AgentCore Gateway

## Architecture Overview

![Architecture Diagram](./images/IDP.drawio.png)

The solution uses a modular architecture with nested CloudFormation stacks to support multiple document processing patterns while maintaining common infrastructure for queueing, tracking, and monitoring.

Current patterns include:
- Pattern 1: Packet or Media processing with Bedrock Data Automation (BDA)
- Pattern 2: OCR → Bedrock Classification (page-level or holistic) → Bedrock Extraction
- Pattern 3: OCR → UDOP Classification (SageMaker) → Bedrock Extraction

## Quick Start

To quickly deploy the GenAI-IDP solution in your AWS account:

1. Log into the [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)
2. Choose the **Launch Stack** button below for your desired region:

| Region name           | Region code | Launch                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| US West (Oregon)      | us-west-2   | [![Launch Stack](https://cdn.rawgit.com/buildkite/cloudformation-launch-stack-button-svg/master/launch-stack.svg)](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aws-ml-blog-us-west-2/artifacts/genai-idp/idp-main.yaml&stackName=IDP) |
| US East (N.Virginia)      | us-east-1   | [![Launch Stack](https://cdn.rawgit.com/buildkite/cloudformation-launch-stack-button-svg/master/launch-stack.svg)](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/aws-ml-blog-us-east-1/artifacts/genai-idp/idp-main.yaml&stackName=IDP) |
| EU Central (Frankfurt)      | eu-central-1   | [![Launch Stack](https://cdn.rawgit.com/buildkite/cloudformation-launch-stack-button-svg/master/launch-stack.svg)](https://eu-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=eu-central-1#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/aws-ml-blog-eu-central-1/artifacts/genai-idp/idp-main.yaml&stackName=IDP) |

3. When the stack deploys for the first time, you'll receive an email with a temporary password to access the web UI
4. Use this temporary password for your first login to set up a permanent password

### Processing Your First Document

After deployment, choose the processing method that fits your use case:

#### Method 1: Web UI (Interactive)

1. Open the Web UI URL from CloudFormation stack Outputs
2. Log in and click "Upload Document"
3. Upload a sample document:
   - For Patterns 1 & 2: [samples/lending_package.pdf](./samples/lending_package.pdf)
   - For Pattern 3: [samples/rvl_cdip_package.pdf](./samples/rvl_cdip_package.pdf)
4. Monitor processing and view results in the dashboard

#### Method 2: Direct S3 Upload (Simple)

1. Upload to the InputBucket (URL in CloudFormation Outputs)
2. Monitor via Step Functions console
3. Results appear in OutputBucket automatically

#### Method 3: IDP CLI (Batch/Programmatic)

For batch processing, automation, or evaluation workflows:

```bash
# Install CLI
cd idp_cli && pip install -e .

# Process documents
idp-cli run-inference \
    --stack-name <your-stack-name> \
    --dir ./samples/ \
    --monitor

# Download results
idp-cli download-results \
    --stack-name <your-stack-name> \
    --batch-id <batch-id> \
    --output-dir ./results/
```
