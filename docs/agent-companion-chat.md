- **Error Handling**: Intelligent error messages and recovery suggestions


## Security and Privacy

### Code Intelligence and Third-Party Services

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Read Before Using Code Intelligence**

The Agent Companion Chat includes an optional Code Intelligence Agent that can provide enhanced code assistance and technical documentation. However, this agent uses third-party MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, which means your queries may be sent to external services.

**What This Means**:
- When Code Intelligence is **enabled**, queries routed to this agent may be sent to external services (DeepWiki MCP server)
- These external services are **not controlled by AWS** or your organization
- Data sent to these services is subject to their privacy policies and terms of service

**Security Best Practices**:

✅ **Safe to Discuss**:
- General IDP features and capabilities
- Public documentation and configuration examples
- Generic code patterns and best practices
- Non-sensitive technical questions
- Publicly available information

❌ **DO NOT Share**:
- Customer names, email addresses, or personal information
- AWS account IDs, API keys, credentials, or secrets
- Proprietary business logic or confidential data
- Internal system details or security configurations
- Actual document content or extracted data
- Customer-specific information or use cases
- Private network configurations or IP addresses

**Built-in Protections**:
- System prompts are configured to prevent the agent from sending sensitive data
- The agent is instructed to refuse requests involving credentials or personal information
- User-controlled toggle allows you to disable the feature entirely

**Recommendations**:
1. **Keep Code Intelligence disabled by default** unless you specifically need code assistance
2. **Review your questions** before sending to ensure they contain no sensitive information
3. **Use other agents** (Analytics, Error Analyzer) for queries involving your actual system data
4. **Enable only when needed** for generic code help, then disable it again

### Data Storage and Retention

**Conversation History**:
- All conversations are stored in DynamoDB within your AWS account
- Conversation history is retained for the duration of your session
- Data remains within your AWS environment and is subject to your AWS security policies
- No conversation data is sent to external services except when Code Intelligence is enabled and invoked

**Session Isolation**:
- Each conversation has a unique session ID
- Sessions are isolated from each other
- Clearing chat creates a new session
- Previous session data is not accessible from new sessions


## Architecture

The Agent Companion Chat uses a session-based architecture that differs fundamentally from the job-based document troubleshooting system. The architecture includes conversation memory, real-time streaming, and intelligent agent orchestration.

### System Components

```
User → Web UI → AppSync GraphQL API → Lambda Functions:
                                      ├── agent_chat_resolver (Entry point)
                                      └── agent_chat_processor (Agent execution)
                                                ↓
                                      Agent System:
                                      ├── Orchestrator Agent (Router)
                                      ├── Analytics Agent
                                      ├── Error Analyzer Agent
                                      ├── Code Intelligence Agent (Optional)
                                      └── External MCP Agents (Optional)
                                                ↓
                                      Storage:
                                      ├── ChatMessagesTable (Message storage)
                                      └── ChatMemoryTable (Conversation history)
                                                ↓
Results ← Web UI ← AppSync Subscription ← Real-time Updates
```

### Architecture Transformation

The companion chat introduces a fundamentally different interaction model from the original Agent Analysis feature:

| Component | Agent Analysis (Original) | Agent Companion Chat (New) |
|-----------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Interaction Model** | Single-shot query/response | Multi-turn conversation |
| **Context** | Job-based (one request → one response) | Session-based with history |
| **Memory** | Stateless | Persistent (last 20 turns) |
| **Agent Selection** | User selects agents before query | Orchestrator routes automatically |
| **Lambda Functions** | `agent_request_handler`, `agent_processor` | `agent_chat_resolver`, `agent_chat_processor` |
| **Storage** | Job results in AgentJobsTable | Messages in ChatMessagesTable + ChatMemoryTable |
| **Streaming** | Final result only | Real-time progressive updates with sub-agent visibility |
| **Follow-up Questions** | Not supported (each query independent) | Supported (remembers conversation context) |
| **UI Location** | Agent Analysis page | Agent Chat page |
| **GraphQL Operations** | `submitAgentQuery`, `getAgentJobStatus` | `sendAgentChatMessage`, `onAgentChatMessageUpdate` |

### Multi-Agent System

The Agent Companion Chat uses a multi-agent architecture with:

1. **Orchestrator Agent**: Routes queries to appropriate specialized agents based on query content
2. **Analytics Agent**: Handles data analysis, metrics, and reporting queries
3. **Error Analyzer Agent**: Diagnoses and troubleshoots document processing failures
4. **Code Intelligence Agent**: Provides code-related assistance and technical documentation (optional)
5. **External MCP Agents**: Custom agents connected via Model Context Protocol servers

### Conversation Memory System

**DynamoDB Memory Provider**:
- Stores conversation history in `ChatMemoryTable`
- Automatically loads last 20 turns on agent initialization
- Groups messages into turns for efficient context management
- Handles 350KB DynamoDB item limits with automatic item creation
- Truncates large messages (8.5KB limit per message)

**Conversation Manager**:
- Implements sliding window management (20 turns default)
- Drops verbose internal tool results while preserving sub-agent responses
- Keeps conversation within model context limits
- Maintains conversation coherence by preserving key information

### Real-Time Streaming

Messages stream in real-time using AWS AppSync GraphQL subscriptions:

**Streaming Flow**:
1. User sends message via GraphQL mutation
2. Message stored in ChatMessagesTable
3. agent_chat_processor invoked asynchronously
4. Agent loads conversation history from ChatMemoryTable
5. Agent processes query and streams response chunks
6. Chunks published via AppSync subscription
7. UI displays chunks progressively
8. Complete turn saved to ChatMemoryTable

**Benefits**:
- Users see responses immediately as they're generated
- No waiting for complete response before seeing anything
- Transparent view of agent thinking process
- Better user experience for long responses

### Security Architecture

The Agent Companion Chat implements a security-first design:

- **Session Isolation**: Each conversation has a unique session ID with isolated data
- **Data Encryption**: All data encrypted at rest in DynamoDB
- **Access Control**: AWS Cognito authentication required for all operations
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring for security reviews
- **Optional External Services**: Code Intelligence requires explicit user consent
- **Minimal Permissions**: Each component requests only necessary AWS permissions

- Final results from the sub-agent
- Any errors encountered

**Example**:
```
🔧 Using Tool: Error Analyzer
   Input: "Analyze recent validation errors"
   
   [Streaming output from Error Analyzer...]
   "Searching CloudWatch logs..."
   "Found 8 validation errors..."
   "Analyzing error patterns..."
   
   ✓ Complete: Root cause identified
```


## Best Practices

### Asking Effective Questions

✅ **Good Questions**:
```
"Show me documents that failed with validation errors today"
"How do I configure the extraction model?"
"What's the average processing time for invoices?"
"Explain how the assessment stage validates data"
```

❌ **Less Effective**:
```
"Help" (too vague)
"Errors" (not specific enough)
"Fix it" (no context)
```

### Using Follow-Up Questions

Take advantage of conversation memory:
```
You: "How many documents failed today?"
Agent: "15 documents failed today..."

You: "Show me the first 5"  ← Agent remembers context
Agent: "Here are the first 5 failed documents..."

You: "What caused the first one?"  ← Still in context
Agent: "The first document failed because..."
```

### When to Start a New Conversation

Start a new chat session when:
- Switching to a completely different topic
- The conversation becomes too long or unfocused
- You want to test the same query without prior context
- You've resolved an issue and want a fresh start

### Security Best Practices

1. **Code Intelligence Usage**: Only enable when needed for generic code help
2. **Data Sensitivity**: Avoid sharing sensitive information in queries
3. **Agent Selection**: Use Analytics/Error Analyzer agents for system-specific queries
4. **Review Questions**: Check your questions before sending when Code Intelligence is enabled

## Common Use Cases

### Investigating System Health

**Scenario**: You want to check if the system is processing documents correctly

```
You: "How many documents were processed in the last hour?"
Agent: "In the last hour, 47 documents were processed with a 94% success rate..."

You: "What about the failures?"
Agent: "There were 3 failures: 2 validation errors and 1 timeout..."

You: "Show me details on the timeout"
Agent: "The timeout occurred for document large_contract.pdf..."
```

### Troubleshooting Recurring Errors

**Scenario**: Multiple documents are failing with similar errors

```
You: "Show me validation errors from today"
Agent: [Displays table of 8 validation errors]

You: "What do these have in common?"
Agent: "All 8 errors involve malformed JSON in extraction prompts..."

You: "How do I fix this?"
Agent: "Update your extraction configuration to escape special characters..."
```

### Learning About Features

**Scenario**: You want to understand how a feature works

```
You: "How does the assessment stage work?"
Agent: "The assessment stage validates extracted data against criteria..."

You: "Can you show me an example configuration?"
Agent: [Displays formatted JSON configuration with explanations]

You: "What models can I use for assessment?"
Agent: "You can use any of these Bedrock models for assessment..."
```

### Analyzing Performance Trends

**Scenario**: You want to understand processing patterns

```
You: "Show me processing trends for the last week"
Agent: [Displays line chart of daily volumes]

You: "Why was Tuesday so high?"
Agent: "Tuesday had 245 documents, which is 3x the daily average..."

You: "What types of documents were processed on Tuesday?"
Agent: [Displays pie chart of document types]
```

### Getting Code Examples

**Scenario**: You need help implementing a custom feature (Code Intelligence enabled)

```
You: "How do I implement a custom extraction prompt?"
Agent: "Here's an example of a custom extraction prompt..."
       [Displays code with syntax highlighting]

You: "How do I add validation to this?"
Agent: "You can add validation by including criteria in your config..."
       [Shows updated code example]
```

## Cost Considerations

The Agent Companion Chat feature uses several AWS services that incur costs:

- **Amazon Bedrock**: Model inference costs for agent processing (varies by model and token usage)
- **AWS Lambda**: Function execution costs for resolver and processor functions
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Storage and request costs for messages and conversation history
- **AWS AppSync**: GraphQL API request and subscription costs
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Log storage and monitoring costs
- **Amazon Athena**: Query execution costs (when Analytics Agent is used)
- **AWS Bedrock AgentCore**: Code interpreter session costs (when Analytics Agent generates visualizations)

**Cost Optimization Tips**:

1. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate models based on accuracy vs. cost requirements
   - Use Claude Sonnet 3.5 for cost-effective general queries
   - Reserve Claude Sonnet 4 for complex reasoning tasks
   - Consider Nova models for AWS-native cost optimization

2. **Conversation Management**: 
   - Start new sessions when switching topics (reduces context size)
   - Clear old conversations you no longer need
   - Keep questions focused to reduce token usage

3. **Code Intelligence**: 
   - Keep disabled when not needed (avoids external MCP costs)
   - Use only for generic code questions

4. **Monitoring**: 
   - Use AWS Cost Explorer to track usage
   - Set up billing alerts for unexpected cost increases
   - Review CloudWatch logs to identify inefficient queries
