### Multi-Agent System

The Agent Analysis feature uses a multi-agent architecture with:

1. **Orchestrator Agent**: Routes queries to appropriate specialized agents based on query content and agent capabilities
2. **Analytics Agent**: Handles data analysis, SQL generation, and visualization creation
3. **External MCP Agents**: Custom agents connected via Model Context Protocol servers

### Agent Workflow

1. **Question Processing**: User submits a natural language question through the web UI
2. **Agent Selection**: User can choose multiple specific agents or let the orchestrator decide automatically
3. **Query Routing**: Orchestrator analyzes the query and routes it to the most appropriate specialized agent
4. **Specialized Processing**: Selected agent processes the query using its specific tools and capabilities
5. **Result Generation**: Agent generates appropriate responses (visualizations, calculations, text, etc.)
6. **Result Display**: Final results are displayed in the web interface with agent conversation history

### Analytics Agent Workflow

For data analysis queries, the Analytics Agent follows this workflow:

1. **Database Discovery**: Agent explores database schema using `get_database_info` tool
2. **SQL Generation**: Agent converts the question into optimized SQL queries with proper column quoting
3. **Query Execution**: SQL queries are executed against Amazon Athena with results stored in S3
4. **Data Processing**: Query results are securely transferred to AWS Bedrock AgentCore sandbox
5. **Visualization Generation**: Python code generates charts or tables from the data
6. **Result Display**: Final visualizations are displayed in the web interface

### Security Architecture

The Agent Analysis feature implements a security-first design:

- **Sandboxed Execution**: All Python code runs in AWS Bedrock AgentCore, completely isolated from the rest of the AWS environment and the internet
- **Secure Data Transfer**: Query results are transferred via S3 and AgentCore APIs, never through direct file system access
- **Session Management**: Code interpreter sessions are properly managed and cleaned up after use
- **Minimal Permissions**: Each component requests only the necessary AWS permissions
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring for security reviews

## Testing with Sample Data

The solution includes sample W2 tax documents for testing the analytics feature:

### Sample Documents Location

- **Path**: `/samples/w2/`
- **Files**: 20 sample W2 documents (W2_XL_input_clean_1000.pdf through W2_XL_input_clean_1019.pdf)
- **Purpose**: Realistic test data for exploring analytics capabilities
- **Source**: Sample W2 documents are from [this kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mcvishnu1/fake-w2-us-tax-form-dataset) and are 100% synthetic with a [CC0 1.0 public domain license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

### Testing Steps

1. **Upload Sample Documents**:

   - Use the Web UI to upload documents from the `/samples/w2/` folder
   - Or copy them directly to the S3 input bucket

2. **Wait for Processing**:

   - Monitor document processing through the Web UI dashboard
   - Ensure all documents complete successfully

3. **Try Sample Queries**:

   ```
   "How many W2 documents have been processed?"

   "Make a bar chart histogram of total earnings in all W2s with bins $25000 wide"

   "What employee from the state of California paid the most tax?"

   "What is the ratio of state tax paid to federal tax paid for the following states: Vermont, Nevada, Indiana, and Oregon?"
   ```

## Configuration

The Agent Analysis feature is configured through CloudFormation parameters:

### Model Selection

```yaml
ChatCompanionModelId:
  Type: String
  Default: "us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0"
  Description: Model to use for Document Analysis Agent (analytics queries)
```

**Supported Models:**

- `us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0` (Default - Recommended)
- `us.anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0`
- `us.anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0`
- `us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0`
- `us.amazon.nova-lite-v1:0`

### Infrastructure Components

The feature automatically creates:

- **DynamoDB Table**: Tracks analytics job status and results
- **Lambda Functions**: Request handler and processor functions
- **AppSync Resolvers**: GraphQL API endpoints for web UI integration
- **IAM Roles**: Minimal permissions for secure operation

### Environment Variables

Key configuration settings:

- `ANALYTICS_TABLE`: DynamoDB table for job tracking
- `ATHENA_DATABASE`: Database containing processed document data
- `ATHENA_OUTPUT_LOCATION`: S3 location for query results
- `CHAT_COMPANION_MODEL_ID`: AI model for agent processing

## Best Practices

### Query Optimization

1. **Start Broad**: Begin with general questions before diving into specifics
2. **Be Specific**: Clearly state what information you're looking for
3. **Use Follow-ups**: Build on what you learned in previous questions to explore topics in depth (note: each question is independent; there is no actual conversation history)
4. **Check Results**: Verify visualizations make sense for your data

### Security Best Practices

1. **Data Access**: Only authenticated users can access analytics features
2. **Query Isolation**: Each user's queries are isolated and tracked separately
3. **Audit Logging**: All queries and results are logged for security reviews
4. **Sandbox Security**: Python code execution is completely isolated from system resources

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Agent Not Responding:**

- Check CloudWatch logs for the Analytics Processor Lambda function
- Verify Bedrock model access is enabled for your selected model
- Ensure sufficient Lambda timeout (15 minutes) for complex queries

**SQL Query Errors:**

- Agent automatically retries failed queries up to 5 times
- Check that column names are properly quoted in generated SQL
- Verify database permissions for Athena access

**Visualization Errors:**

- Check that query results contain expected data types
- Verify Python code generation in AgentCore sandbox
- Review agent messages for detailed error information

**Performance Issues:**

- Consider using simpler queries for large datasets
- Try breaking complex questions into smaller parts
- Monitor Athena query performance and optimize if needed

### Monitoring and Logging

- **CloudWatch Logs**: Detailed logs for both Lambda functions
- **DynamoDB Console**: View job status and results directly
- **Athena Console**: Monitor SQL query execution and performance
- **Agent Messages**: Real-time display of agent reasoning in web UI

## Cost Considerations

The Agent Analysis feature uses several AWS services that incur costs:

- **Amazon Bedrock**: Model inference costs for agent processing
- **AWS Bedrock AgentCore**: Code interpreter session costs
- **Amazon Athena**: Query execution costs based on data scanned
- **Amazon S3**: Storage costs for query results
- **AWS Lambda**: Function execution costs
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Storage and request costs for job tracking

To optimize costs:

- Choose appropriate Bedrock models based on accuracy vs. cost requirements
- Monitor usage through AWS Cost Explorer

## Integration with Other Features

The Agent Analysis feature has access to _all_ tables that the GenAIIDP stores in Athena. Therefore it integrates seamlessly with other GenAIIDP capabilities:

### Evaluation Framework Integration

- Query evaluation metrics and accuracy scores
- Analyze patterns in document processing quality
- Compare performance across different processing patterns

### Assessment Feature Integration
