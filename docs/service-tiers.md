# Amazon Bedrock Service Tiers

The GenAI IDP solution supports Amazon Bedrock service tiers through model ID suffixes, allowing you to optimize for performance and cost by selecting different service tiers for model inference operations.

## Overview

Amazon Bedrock offers three service tiers for on-demand inference:

| Tier | Performance | Cost | Best For |
|------|-------------|------|----------|
| **Priority** | Fastest response times | Premium pricing (~25% more) | Customer-facing workflows, real-time interactions |
| **Standard** | Consistent performance | Regular pricing | Everyday AI tasks, content generation |
| **Flex** | Variable latency | Discounted pricing | Batch processing, evaluations, non-urgent workloads |

## Model ID Suffix Format

Service tiers are specified using model ID suffixes:

**Format:** `<base-model-id>[:<service-tier>]`

**Examples:**
- `us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0` → Standard tier (default, no suffix)
- `us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0:flex` → Flex tier
- `us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0:priority` → Priority tier
- `global.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0:flex` → Global model with Flex tier

## Available Models with Service Tiers

The following Nova 2 Lite models are available with service tier suffixes:

**US Region Models:**
- `us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0` (Standard - default)
- `us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0:flex` (Flex tier)
- `us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0:priority` (Priority tier)

**Global Models:**
- `global.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0` (Standard - default)
- `global.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0:flex` (Flex tier)
- `global.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0:priority` (Priority tier)

## Configuration

### Using Model IDs with Service Tier Suffixes

Simply specify the model ID with the desired tier suffix in your configuration:

```yaml
classification:
  model: "us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0:priority"  # Fast classification
  # ... other settings

extraction:
  model: "us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0:flex"  # Cost-effective extraction
  # ... other settings

assessment:
  model: "us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0"  # Standard tier (no suffix)
  # ... other settings
```

### How It Works

When you specify a model ID with a service tier suffix:

1. The system parses the model ID to extract the base model and tier
2. The base model ID (without suffix) is passed to the Bedrock API
3. The extracted tier is passed as the `serviceTier` parameter
4. Example: `us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0:flex` becomes:
   - Model ID: `us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0`
   - Service Tier: `flex`

## Web UI Configuration

### Selecting Models with Service Tiers

1. Navigate to the Configuration page
2. In each operation section (Classification, Extraction, Assessment, Summarization):
   - Find the "Model" dropdown
   - Select a model with the desired tier suffix:
     - Models ending in `:flex` use Flex tier
     - Models ending in `:priority` use Priority tier
     - Models without suffix use Standard tier
3. Changes save automatically

The model dropdown will show all available models including those with tier suffixes.

## Use Cases and Recommendations

### Priority Tier
**When to use:**
- Customer-facing document processing
- Real-time classification needs
- Interactive applications
- Time-sensitive workflows

**Example configuration:**
```yaml
classification:
  model: "us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0:priority"
  # Fast classification for real-time user uploads
```

### Standard Tier (Default)
**When to use:**
- General document processing
- Balanced performance and cost
- Most production workloads
- Default choice when unsure

**Example configuration:**
```yaml
extraction:
  model: "us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0"
  # No suffix = standard tier
```

### Flex Tier
**When to use:**
- Batch document processing
- Evaluation and testing workflows
- Non-urgent background jobs
- Cost optimization scenarios

**Example configuration:**
```yaml
extraction:
  model: "us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0:flex"
  # Cost-effective for batch processing
```

## Mixed Tier Strategy

You can use different tiers for different operations:

```yaml
classification:
  model: "us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0:priority"
  # Fast classification for user experience

extraction:
  model: "us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0:flex"
  # Cost-effective extraction (can tolerate latency)

assessment:
  model: "us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0"
  # Standard tier for assessment
```

## Performance Expectations

Based on AWS documentation:

- **Priority**: Up to 25% better OTPS (Output Tokens Per Second) latency vs Standard
- **Standard**: Consistent baseline performance
- **Flex**: Variable latency, suitable for batch workloads where speed is less critical

Actual performance varies by:
- Model size and complexity
- Request payload size
- Current system load
- AWS region

## Cost Implications

- **Priority**: ~25% premium over Standard pricing
- **Standard**: Baseline pricing (reference point)
- **Flex**: Discounted pricing compared to Standard

**Important:** Always refer to the [AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws) for current pricing information.

## Monitoring

### CloudWatch Logs

Service tier information appears in CloudWatch logs:

```
Using service tier: flex
Extracted service tier 'flex' from model ID. Using base model ID: us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0
```

### Metrics

CloudWatch metrics include service tier as a dimension, allowing you to:
- Track usage by tier
- Compare performance across tiers
- Analyze cost by tier

## Troubleshooting

### Model ID Not Recognized

**Problem:** Model with tier suffix not working

**Solution:** Verify the model ID format:
- Correct: `us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0:flex`
- Incorrect: `us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0-flex`
- Incorrect: `us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0_flex`

### Service Tier Not Applied

**Problem:** Service tier not being used

**Solution:** Check CloudWatch logs for:
- "Extracted service tier" messages
- "Using service tier" messages
- Verify model ID includes tier suffix

### Invalid Tier Suffix

**Problem:** Using unsupported tier suffix

**Solution:** Only `flex` and `priority` suffixes are supported. Standard tier is the default (no suffix needed).

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Standard**: Use standard tier (no suffix) as your baseline
2. **Optimize Selectively**: Add tier suffixes only where needed
3. **Monitor Costs**: Track spending by tier using CloudWatch metrics
4. **Test Performance**: Measure actual latency differences for your workload
5. **Use Flex for Batch**: Leverage Flex tier for non-urgent batch processing
6. **Reserve Priority**: Use Priority tier only for latency-sensitive operations

## Model Compatibility

Not all Bedrock models support all service tiers. Priority and Flex tiers are supported by:
- Amazon Nova models
- OpenAI models
- Qwen models
- DeepSeek models

If a model doesn't support the specified tier, the Bedrock API will return an error.
