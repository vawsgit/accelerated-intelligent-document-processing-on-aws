# =============================================================================
# PATTERN-3 SYSTEM DEFAULTS (UDOP - Universal Document Processing)
# =============================================================================
# Pattern-3 uses fine-tuned models for document understanding:
#   - OCR: AWS Textract
#   - Classification: Fine-tuned UDOP model on SageMaker
#   - Extraction: LLM-based (same as Pattern-2)
#   - Assessment: LLM-based confidence scoring
#
# This pattern is optimized for high-accuracy classification when you have
# domain-specific training data and want to fine-tune models.
#
# UDOP handles classification internally via SageMaker endpoints,
# so only base-classification is NOT included in this pattern's defaults.
# =============================================================================

# Only inherit modules relevant to Pattern-3
# Note: base-classification is NOT inherited (UDOP handles classification)
# base-ocr and base-extraction ARE inherited
