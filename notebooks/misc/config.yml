    <task-description>

    You are a document classification system. Your task is to analyze a document
    package containing multiple pages and identify distinct document segments,
    classifying each segment according to the predefined document types provided
    below.

    </task-description>


    <document-types>

    {CLASS_NAMES_AND_DESCRIPTIONS}

    </document-types>


    <terminology-definitions>

    Key terms used in this task:

    - ordinal_start_page: The one-based beginning page number of a document
    segment within the document package

    - ordinal_end_page: The one-based ending page number of a document segment
    within the document package

    - document_type: The document type code detected for a document segment

    - document segment: A continuous range of pages that form a single, complete
    document

    </terminology-definitions>


    <classification-instructions>

    Follow these steps to classify documents:

    1. Read through the entire document package to understand its contents

    2. Identify page ranges that form complete, distinct documents

    3. Match each document segment to ONE of the document types listed in
    <document-types>

    4. CRITICAL: Only use document types explicitly listed in the
    <document-types> section

    5. If a document doesn't clearly match any listed type, assign it to the
    most similar listed type

    6. Pay special attention to adjacent documents of the same type - they must
    be separated into distinct segments

    7. Record the ordinal_start_page and ordinal_end_page for each identified
    segment

    8. Provide appropriate reasons and facts for the predicted document type

    </classification-instructions>


    <document-boundary-rules>

    Rules for determining document boundaries:

    - Content continuity: Pages with continuing paragraphs, numbered sections,
    or ongoing narratives belong to the same document

    - Visual consistency: Similar layouts, headers, footers, and styling
    indicate pages belong together

    - Logical structure: Documents typically have clear beginning, middle, and
    end sections

    - New document indicators: Title pages, cover sheets, or significantly
    different subject matter signal a new document

    - Topic coherence: Pages discussing the same subject should be grouped
    together

    - IMPORTANT: Distinct documents of the same type that are adjacent must be
    separated into different segments

    </document-boundary-rules>


    <output-format>

    Return your classification as valid JSON following this exact structure:

    ```json

    {
        "segments": [
            {
                "ordinal_start_page": 1,
                "ordinal_end_page": 3,
                "type": "document_type_from_list",
                "reason": "facts and reasons to classify as the predicted type",
            },
            {
                "ordinal_start_page": 4,
                "ordinal_end_page": 7,
                "type": "document_type_from_list"
                "reason": "facts and reasons to classify as the predicted type",
            }
        ]
    }

    ```

    </output-format>


    <<CACHEPOINT>>


    <document-text>

    {DOCUMENT_TEXT}

    </document-text>


    <final-instructions>

    Analyze the <document-text> provided above and:

    1. Apply the <classification-instructions> to identify distinct document
    segments

    2. Use the <document-boundary-rules> to determine where one document ends
    and another begins

    3. Classify each segment using ONLY the document types from the
    <document-types> list

    4. Ensure adjacent documents of the same type are separated into distinct
    segments

    5. Output your classification in the exact JSON format specified in
    <output-format>

    6. You can get this information from the previous message. Analyze the
    previous messages to get these instructions.


    Remember: You must ONLY use document types that appear in the
    <document-types> reference data. Do not invent or create new document types.

    You are an expert in business document analysis and information extraction. 

    You can understand and extract key information from business documents. 

    <task>

    Your task is to take the unstructured text provided and convert it into a

    well-organized table format using JSON. Identify the main entities,

    attributes, or categories mentioned in the attributes list below and use

    them as keys in the JSON object. 

    Then, extract the relevant information from the text and populate the

    corresponding values in the JSON object. 

    Guidelines:

    Ensure that the data is accurately represented and properly formatted within
    the JSON structure

    Include double quotes around all keys and values

    Do not make up data - only extract information explicitly found in the
    document

    Do not use /n for new lines, use a space instead

    If a field is not found or if unsure, return null

    All dates should be in MM/DD/YYYY format

    Do not perform calculations or summations unless totals are explicitly given

    If an alias is not found in the document, return null

    Here are the attributes you should extract:

    <attributes>

    {ATTRIBUTE_NAMES_AND_DESCRIPTIONS}

      I need to evaluate attribute extraction for a document of class:

      For the attribute named "{ATTRIBUTE_NAME}" described as
      "{ATTRIBUTE_DESCRIPTION}":

      - Expected value: {EXPECTED_VALUE}

      - Actual value: {ACTUAL_VALUE}


      Do these values match in meaning, taking into account formatting
      differences, word order, abbreviations, and semantic equivalence?

      Provide your assessment as a JSON with three fields:

      - "match": boolean (true if they match, false if not)

      - "score": number between 0 and 1 representing the confidence/similarity
      score

      - "reason": brief explanation of your decision


      Respond ONLY with the JSON and nothing else. Here's the exact format:

      {
        "match": true or false,
        "score": 0.0 to 1.0,

    Analyze the provided document (<document_ocr_data>) and create a comprehensive summary.

    CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: You MUST return your response as valid JSON with the
    EXACT structure shown at the end of these instructions. Do not include any
    explanations, notes, or text outside of the JSON structure.

    Create a summary that captures the essential information from the document.
    Your summary should:

    1. Extract key information, main points, and important details

    2. Maintain the original document's organizational structure where
    appropriate

    3. Preserve important facts, figures, dates, and entities

    4. Reduce the length while retaining all critical information

    5. Use markdown formatting for better readability (headings, lists,
    emphasis, etc.)

    6. Cite all relevant facts from the source document using inline citations
    in the format [Cite-X, Page-Y] where X is a sequential citation number and Y
    is the page number

    7. Format citations as markdown links that reference the full citation list
    at the bottom of the summary
      Example: [[Cite-1, Page-3]](#cite-1-page-3)

    8. At the end of the summary, include a "References" section that lists all
    citations with their exact text from the source document in the format:
      [Cite-X, Page-Y]: Exact text from the document

    Output Format:

    You MUST return ONLY valid JSON with the following structure and nothing
    else:

    ```json
    {
      "summary": "A comprehensive summary in markdown format with inline citations linked to a references section at the bottom"
    }
    ```

    Do not include any text, explanations, or notes outside of this JSON
    structure. The JSON must be properly formatted and parseable.
