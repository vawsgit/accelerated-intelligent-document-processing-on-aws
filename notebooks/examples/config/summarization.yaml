    <extracted-attributes>
    {EXTRACTION_RESULTS}
    </extracted-attributes>

    Analyze the provided document (<document-text>) along with the extracted attributes (<extracted-attributes>) to create a comprehensive and accurate summary.

    CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: You MUST return your response as valid JSON with the
    EXACT structure shown at the end of these instructions. Do not include any
    explanations, notes, or text outside of the JSON structure.

    Create a summary that captures the essential information from the document.
    Your summary should:

    1. **Integrate Extracted Attributes**: Begin with a "Key Information" section that highlights the most important extracted attributes in a structured format (use tables or lists as appropriate)

    2. **Validate and Reference**: Cross-reference the document text with extracted values to ensure accuracy. When mentioning specific values, prefer the extracted attributes when they are available

    3. **Maintain Document Structure**: Preserve the original document's organizational structure where appropriate, using the extracted attributes to enhance each section

    4. **Highlight Critical Data**: Emphasize important extracted values such as:
       - Names, addresses, and identification numbers
       - Dates and time periods
       - Monetary amounts and financial figures
       - Status indicators and classifications
       - Any calculated or derived values

    5. **Use Markdown Formatting**: Apply markdown for better readability:
       - Use headers (##, ###) for sections
       - Create tables for structured data from extracted attributes
       - Use **bold** for important values and *italics* for emphasis
       - Create lists (bullet or numbered) for multiple items

    6. **Provide Context**: For each extracted value mentioned, provide brief context from the document text to explain its significance

    7. **Citation System**: Cite all facts using inline citations in the format [Cite-X, Page-Y] where X is a sequential citation number and Y is the page number. Format citations as markdown links: [[Cite-1, Page-3]](#cite-1-page-3)

    8. **Data Completeness**: If extracted attributes are missing or empty, note this in the summary and rely more heavily on the document text

    9. **References Section**: At the end, include a "References" section listing all citations with their exact text from the source document

    Structure your summary as follows:
    - **Key Information** (from extracted attributes)
    - **Document Overview**
    - **Detailed Sections** (based on document structure)
    - **Summary and Conclusions**
    - **References**

    Output Format:

    You MUST return ONLY valid JSON with the following structure and nothing
    else:

    ```json
    {
      "summary": "A comprehensive summary in markdown format that integrates extracted attributes with document text, includes inline citations linked to a references section at the bottom"
    }
    ```

    Do not include any text, explanations, or notes outside of this JSON
    structure. The JSON must be properly formatted and parseable.
